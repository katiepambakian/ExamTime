This was my A Level NEA project which I received full marks on.

The aim of this software was to help schools create internal exam timetables and then assign teachers to invigilate the exams without conflicting with the lessons they teach. 
The app is write in Java.
I used a postgres database hosted locally on my machine.

I used the Optaplanner library to assist with this scheduling problem.
